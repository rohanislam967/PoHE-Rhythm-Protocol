# PoHE Rhythm Protocol 🚀
**Proof of Human Existence (PoHE) via Behavioral Biometrics & Rhythmic Pattern Recognition.**

---

## 📌 Overview
PoHE Rhythm Protocol is a next-generation anti-bot verification system designed for the Web3 ecosystem. Unlike traditional CAPTCHAs, it utilizes **Behavioral Biometrics** to distinguish between humans and automated scripts by analyzing the natural timing variance (rhythm) in human interactions.

## ✨ Core Features
- **Rhythmic Analysis:** Detects human-specific timing patterns with a precision threshold (currently 10ms variance).
- **Anti-Bot Mechanism:** Automatically blocks perfectly consistent inputs (scripts/bots) and extreme speed anomalies.
- **Audio Feedback:** Integrated real-time interaction feedback for a professional user experience.
- **Web3 Ready:** Designed to integrate with Arbitrum Layer-2 for on-chain verification.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Futuristic UI)
- **Logic:** JavaScript (Behavioral Analysis Engine)
- **Network (Future):** Arbitrum Sepolia Testnet

## 🗺️ Roadmap
- [x] **Phase 1:** Core Rhythm Logic & Basic UI
- [ ] **Phase 2:** Device Motion Integration (Gyroscope/Accelerometer analysis)
- [ ] **Phase 3:** Arbitrum Smart Contract Integration (On-chain Proof of Personhood)
- [ ] **Phase 4:** Mainnet Deployment & Developer SDK

## 🏗️ Technical Logic
The protocol calculates the variance between consecutive interaction timestamps. 
- If `Variance < 10ms` -> **Bot Detected** (Too perfect)
- If `Average Gap < 200ms` -> **Suspicious Speed** (Script suspected)
- Otherwise -> **Human Confirmed** (Natural rhythm)
